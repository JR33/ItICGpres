							<h1> Overview </h1>
							<h2> Topic </h2>
							<p>LifeQuest is an augmented reality role playing game for a mobile device using GPS tracking to allow the real world to be the setting for the game. Lifequest shows a map of your current location, allowing the player to explore the world finding quests to complete to gain in-game currency and loot such as armour and weapons for your character. The main focus of this game is to encourage people to exercise by creating quests tailored around fitness, an example of a quest, could be a delivery style quests; you may get a quest at flinders station to deliver a note to a dwarf that is at the Eureka Skydeck. The player must physically walk from flinders to a close proximity of the Eureka Skydeck in order to complete this quest.</p>
							<p>Lifequest is a multiplayer game which allows players to party up with friends in real life to quests and gain loot together. Each player can create their own character to their specific play style, so a party can consist of various classes such as a mage, warrior, white mage and fighter that have different abilities to aid in the party’s battles. Each players’ characters are customisable, allowing the player to choose their player's gender and apply key features such as hair style, hair colour, body type and some basic clothing. The armour that is found during the user’s playtime is equipable and will be visually seen on the player, as well as weapons that are looted from quests or enemies.</p>
							<h2> Motivation </h2>
							<p>Video games can be a detrimental activity to a person’s health if not played in moderation and balanced with other aspects of one’s lifestyle such as exercise. Gaming usually consists of sitting in front of a computer or TV and playing for several hours straight. In this world of ever-growing gaming technology there is a loss in the daily exercise that is so important to one's health. In saying this, Lifequest’s goal is to combine gaming and exercise together to allow gamers to pursue their passion whilst also exercising in the process.  Augmented reality has the potential to be a massive component in gaming, as seen with games such Pokémon GO as it became a global trend that captivated the world for about 6 months to a year, when the hype eventually died down due to the slow update time. There is a massive space in the market for a game like this, as there are no current RPGs that feature elements of augmented reality on the mobile gaming market. A game like Lifequest has the opportunity to open up a whole new category of gaming, by connecting AR components to other genres of games, Lifequest can be a catalyst to a new aspect of gaming. </p>
							<h2> Landscape </h2>
							<p> <img src="images/pmap.png" ALIGN="right" width = '207.5' length ='93.75' />Life Quest is an AR RPG that draws inspiration from games like Pokémon Go and Ingress, these games allow the player to take the game to the real world, Pokémon Go allows the user to live their childhood dreams as a Pokémon trainer by exploring the world in the search of Pokémon. The game allows this by randomly spawning Pokémon around the world, which the user can then find and try to capture.  Life Quest is similar in the way that we have random quests and encounters that will spawn around the world, that players can choose to accept or decline. Pokémon Go also has a feature called poke stops which are pre-selected key points where the user can collect a variety of random rewards such as different types of poke balls and food to help catch Pokémon. Similarly, Life Quest has implemented merchants/shops that are not randomly allocated but based on popular hotspots around the world. An example, If you live in Melbourne, a shop could be at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) which allows the user to repair or upgrade their armour and by health and mana potions. What separates Pokémon Go and Life Quest is the quests that focus on exercise, many of Life Quest’s quests will be focused on allowing the user to become more active, of course, it will be within reason and measurable, so the player will not be expected to get on the ground a begin doing push-ups but rather they may need to walk to a certain landmark within a time limit. </p>
							<p><img src="images/ff.PNG" ALIGN="right" />Another massive component of Life Quest is that it is a Role Player Game, some similar games are Final Fantasy, Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) and World of Warcraft(WoW).  Life Quest’s battle scenarios are most similar to Final Fantasy as it is a turn-based concept that allows the player to choose an attack and their target, then the scenario unfolds showing the damage the player dealt and the damage done to them. Whereas games like ESO and WoW use an active style of combat (Figure 2)  as the player can run using W,A,S,D, use abilities by pressing the number keys and use the mouse for aiming. This method was not realistic for a mobile game, as it would be extremely difficult and uncomfortable to do without a keyboard and mouse. Also, a mobile phone would not be able to <img src="images/eso.PNG" ALIGN="left" /> run a massive open-world game like WoW or ESO. A huge part of MMORPG’S (Mass Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) are gear and weapon sets, all three games above include some sort of gear sets. A gear set is a unique style of armour that when all the pieces are equipped give the player a boost in a certain stat based on the type of gear set. ESO does a great and simple way of accomplishing practical use of gear sets, an example is the Arch-Mage gear set, when a player has all 5 pieces of armour equipped they get increased magicka recovery and other stats when they have 2, 3 and 4 pieces equipped. This style of gear sets would likely be the most applicable to life quest as it is rather simple and easy to understand.</p>
