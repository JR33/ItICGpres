							<h1>Skills and Jobs</h1>
							<h2> Position description 1 </h2>
							<p> The first person who I would hire for this project would be a UX specialist. They would be responsible for designing the bulk of the user interface of the app. As an expert in this field, they would get almost complete independence in designing the interface, as long as they include every button and feature that is required for the app. To effectively do this, the person would require extensive knowledge of some kind of design program, which would allow them to actually design the elements of the app that they are responsible for. They would also need extensive knowledge of how users interact with apps, and how to design an app to make it easy for the user to interact with. They would need strong teamwork skills, as they would need to work closely with the software engineer for the app, to ensure that the visual design of the app works well with the features implemented by the software designer. </p>
							<h2> Position description 2 </h2>
							<p> Another person who I would hire for this project would be a graphic design artist. This person would be responsible for designing the art of the app, things like the backgrounds of different scenes, in-game items and characters. This person would have complete autonomy to design things exactly how they would like to, as this would allow them to keep a consistent theme across the entire game. They would have to have a portfolio of past designs that showcase their skills in order to be hired for this role. They would have to have expertise in using graphic design software, to allow them to actually design art for the game. They would also need some teamwork skills to allow them to create characters based on design briefs given to them by the character and story developers of the team. </p>
							<h2> Position description 3 </h2>
							<p> Another person who I would hire for this project would be a software designer. This person would be responsible for coding the game. They would have to have experience at using a coding language that is compatible with both apple and android operating systems, as this app will be available across both. They would also need to know how to implement code from fitness tracking technologies, to allow for the fitness tracking that is a crucial part of the game. The software designer would also have to have strong teamwork and management skills, as they would have to implement ideas from every other member of the team and therefore would become a sort of de facto manager for the project. They would have to implement the UI design of the UX specialist, and the art created by the graphics designer, as well as the story elements created by the storywriter and finally the actual game mechanics that have been detailed in this report. </p>
							<h2> Position description 4 </h2>
							<p> The final person I would hire for this project would be a storywriter. This person would be responsible for creating the various quests and side quests given to players. They would have to have a portfolio of story ideas and full stories to show their skills in story writing. They would also need excellent teamwork skills, as they would have to work closely with the software engineer to understand the limitations and possibilities in the app, in regards to the fitness tracking systems, to understand what they are able to do with quests. They would need innovative ideas to ensure that the story is still amusing and entertaining, whilst still encouraging the player to be active. They would also need to direct the graphic designer as to how specific quest related items should look, a further test of their teamwork skills. They may also have to write dialogue for the characters during story scenes, and would therefore need to show that they are able to do that before being hired. </p>
