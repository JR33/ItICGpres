							<h2> Group Reflection </h2>
							<p> For assignment 3, our group worked in a, not necessarily timely, but enjoyable and amusing fashion. Our communication was a particular strong point, as everyone regularly updated the group on how things were going through discord, and people were quick to notify the group if they were unable to attend scheduled meetings This ensured that everyone knew roughly where we were at with the project, and how much more each member had to do to get it completed on time. Additionally, the entire group was extremely receptive to each other's ideas, and as a result we were able to have meaningful discussions on those ideas to determine which we as a group liked best. Furthermore, the skills of our group worked out in such a way that the weaknesses in one person’s skill set were compensated for in another person’s skill set. For example, Josh is not very creative, and therefore did not have the required skills to create art for the game. However, Mark, Kenneth and James all had the required skills to do so, ensuring that the group was able to complete every part of the assignment effectively. However there was room for improvement. Our time management as a group could have been better, as we left it fairly late to complete our assignment and hand it in. Additionally, communication can always be improved, simply to make the group function even better than it already did. Things that were surprising were how good the quality of work was, in relation to the artwork that was created. It was surprising how good certain group members were at creating exceptional artwork for use in the game. It was also surprising how much the group achieved in such a short space of time, as the concept of the game was fully realised, a working prototype was created, a significant amount of artwork was created and music was created for the game. We learned that for a group to work together effectively, the most important things were communication, spreading out the workload evenly, and befriending other members of the group. Good communication allowed our group to determine who had the necessary skills for particular tasks, which allowed us to evenly spread out the workload. This ensured that everything was completed in a timely and effective fashion. Additionally, befriending everyone in the group made working together feel like a fun project with friends, instead of just work, making the project easier to complete. </p>
