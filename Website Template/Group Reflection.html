							<h1>Reflections</h1>
							<h2> Group Reflection </h2>
							<p> For assignment 3, our group worked in a, not necessarily timely, but enjoyable and amusing fashion. Our communication was a particular strong point, as everyone regularly updated the group on how things were going through discord, and people were quick to notify the group if they were unable to attend scheduled meetings This ensured that everyone knew roughly where we were at with the project, and how much more each member had to do to get it completed on time. Additionally, the entire group was extremely receptive to each other's ideas, and as a result we were able to have meaningful discussions on those ideas to determine which we as a group liked best. Furthermore, the skills of our group worked out in such a way that the weaknesses in one person’s skill set were compensated for in another person’s skill set. For example, Josh is not very creative, and therefore did not have the required skills to create art for the game. However, Mark, Kenneth and James all had the required skills to do so, ensuring that the group was able to complete every part of the assignment effectively. However there was room for improvement. Our time management as a group could have been better, as we left it fairly late to complete our assignment and hand it in. Additionally, communication can always be improved, simply to make the group function even better than it already did. Things that were surprising were how good the quality of work was, in relation to the artwork that was created. It was surprising how good certain group members were at creating exceptional artwork for use in the game. It was also surprising how much the group achieved in such a short space of time, as the concept of the game was fully realised, a working prototype was created, a significant amount of artwork was created and music was created for the game. We learned that for a group to work together effectively, the most important things were communication, spreading out the workload evenly, and befriending other members of the group. Good communication allowed our group to determine who had the necessary skills for particular tasks, which allowed us to evenly spread out the workload. This ensured that everything was completed in a timely and effective fashion. Additionally, befriending everyone in the group made working together feel like a fun project with friends, instead of just work, making the project easier to complete. </p>
							<h2> Individual reflections </h2>
							<h3>Oscar</h3>
							<p> Groups can be very complex, it can be an absolute rollercoaster of emotions, struggles and great times. Ours was no different, but i do believe that overall we worked very well, specifically our communication made leaps and bounds from the last assignment, as meetings became more punctual, if someone could not attend, they made it very clear beforehand and the constant progress updates made us all feel on the same page. Although, something that could be improved, was moving our content to the website earlier, as this was done on the same day as the assignment was due. A part of the assignments that truly surprised me was the talent of our design team, specifically Mark, as presenting his sketches and pixel art was incredible. Groups are learning experiences, something that I have learnt from this experience, is that when you have a group that you get along well with, the assignment becomes less of a chore and actually very enjoyable. </p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p> In the duration of these past three weeks, our group’s punctuality to the meetings and their receptiveness to the designers’ creations shined out the greatest. They respected the need for creating the designs and the importance of our group’s meetings. We all truly pulled our weight in the time of this assignment. Some things I believed could be improved would be the limitations set on a majority of the designs, they made little semantic sense in the long run of the project and they forced detail to be sacrificed for the sake of the core object being realised. One thing I found surprising about this assignment was how many designs I was able to create specifically using pixel art, pixel art is a hard form to work with, so I’m grateful I was able to work with it. One thing I found surprising about groups this time around was how there wasn’t a lot of criticisms about the ideas or designs presented to the group, I honestly believed there’d be constructive criticisms about my designs, I obviously enjoyed the fact that my designs were liked by the group, but it would’ve been nice to hear how it could be improved.  </p>
							<h3>Darren</h3>
							<p> After a few weeks with the group, I personally think the group has been really excellent according to me. Everyone manages to do their tasks in time and everyone can do their tasks rather well. Everyone can attend all the meetings most of the time and if someone can’t attend a meeting, then that person will notify everyone in the group. Personally for me, the only thing that I think can be improved is that the communication can be improved a bit more. One time, I was asking the group whether we are gonna be having a meeting, but no one responded until a few hours later. It could be a possibility that all of the members were busy or they were not notified until some time later, but I find that the communication was really good, but I think it could be a bit more better, still a bit better than the previous assignment’s meeting though and for that, I must give credit where credit is due. One thing I found about this group that was surprising was the amount of effort everyone put in, especially the art team, the art team for me really was just amazing working really hard on the art of the characters and their animation for the game. Another thing that I find surprising is that everyone was really working hard and carried the spirit from the previous assignment all the way to this assignment. One thing that I have learned a lot from this group is communication is key, as well as, dedication. Everyone in the group has put in a lot of time and effort in order for any assignment to succeed. </p>
							<h3>Mark</h3>
							<p> After working with the group more, I'd say the group had more synergies and as a whole we worked together better.All of the meetings went well and the group was more organized on everything we worked on.Each member also did their own part with great effectiveness, sticking to our most of out assigned deadlines and the group had a pretty even amount of work spread so it's not too reliant on someone to finish big sections of the report alone.One way that my experience could have been better is that consistency on working on the project especially with a limited amount of time given to finish the project. Though the group started working pretty early, the team worked much more intensely later on during the timespan of the project. Even then It surprised me how much the team has actually achieved during the given time. Each member made crucial contributions during the process and how much was done because the team had better communication.Everything that needed to be done was completed and the group managed to balance group work and individual ones pretty well. One thing I got from this is how important management is to the workflow of the group, rather be it time management, communication, or work spread. With good management , the team was able to complete each task effectively and create better results for the team. </p>
							<h3>Kenneth</h3>
							<p> For this assessment, most everything ran smoother than it did than the last assessment. Communication improved; updates and progress reports were freqent on Discord and we had frequent discussions on the limitations to the game whether that be the AR aspect, game design or using Unity, and organization improved; an agenda was set out for every meeting. This assessment was heavier content wise, so while the group was hard at work, we found ourselves meeting the deadline sooner than expected (even accounting for last assignment's extension). This could be improved as I remember there not being any progress reports being made within the first week or messages on discord regarding A3 soon after finishing A2. What surprised me was not only the versatility of the entire group's skills but also the depth of their skills or willingness to learn and take on new or challenging tasks. We had an art team design a large variety of sprites, all three of us new to creating with the medium, Oscar dabbling in Unity and finishing a programm in Python, Darren completing the story and features of the game and Joshua on the behind-the-scenes website editing, content writing, suggestion of tools and more 'digital housekeeping'. I have learnt that it takes some adapting to do when it comes to working in a creative team regarding idea generation and implementation, as we all come from different backgrounds and experiences in the games we play and our sources of inspiration. Me saying 'show the planes and dimensions of the object' confered a different meaning to another member when suggesting designs for the tome icon. They instead came back with a 'different angle' which wasn't at all what I thought I would see, leading to further discussion on icon design. </p>
							<h3>Josh</h3>
							<p> During the course of this assignment our group worked very well together. Everyone was extremely receptive to everyone else’s ideas and we were able to have reasonable discussions to determine what the best idea for a particular aspect of the project would be. This allowed us to quickly proceed with agreed upon courses of action. However, our time management could have been improved, as we still had quite a lot of work to do one the final day that we could submit the assignment on. However, we did still get it done in time. This could have been improved by simply starting the assignment earlier, as we did wait slightly too long between properly starting work on assignment 3 after the completion of assignment 2. One thing that surprised me was how good members of our group were at creating the art and music for our project, as it was all spectacular. In particular, James created many sprites of characters and animations of attacks, as well as creating music for the game, Kenneth created enemies for the game that the player would fight and Mark worked on sprites that faced in different directions, to give us more options in the game. One thing I learned about groups was that every member of the group has talents that they don’t necessarily share straight away, but can be incredibly useful when they are revealed. In this case, the artistic talents of Kenneth, James and Mark were incredibly useful to our project. </p>
